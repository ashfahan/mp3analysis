# To Run

just use `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run code in dev mode. use postman to make api calls. `/file-upload` is the route that would work all others will throw not found 404

# Success Response

# Architecture Design

the folder structure are designed to provide maximum modularization and easy to maintain the code

- assets: This directory holds all the static assets needed for my project, including images, audio files, documents, and more. I find it convenient to centralize these resources, making them easier to manage and reference throughout my codebase.
- src: As the core of my project, the 'src' directory encompasses all my source code. Breaking it down:
  - helpers: Here, I store pure functions crafted to support various parts of my application. These functions serve as essential building blocks, providing functionalities that I can reuse across different modules.
  - routes: This is where I implement endpoints or URIs to handle client requests. Each route corresponds to a specific feature or resource within my application, ensuring a clear and organized structure.
  - schema: In this directory, I define data schemas responsible for data validation and error handling. Clear data structures help ensure accurate and consistent data processing, reducing the likelihood of errors.
  - services: Services are encapsulated modules that perform specialized tasks and can interact with other parts of my application. The 'audio' subdirectory reflects my focus on audio-related functionalities, showcasing the modularity and extensibility of my project.
  - utils: Here, I store utilities, constants, translations, and other shared functionalities. This central repository of commonly used tools facilitates code reuse and promotes consistency across my project.
- uploads: Dedicated to storing files uploaded by clients, this directory provides a segregated space for managing user-generated content. Keeping these files separate from my source code and assets ensures efficient handling and retrieval, contributing to a smoother user experience.

This project structure, from my perspective, embodies best practices in software development, fostering a clean and organized codebase. It not only simplifies maintenance and collaboration but also lays a strong foundation for future expansion and feature enhancements.
