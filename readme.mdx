Project
├─── assets (contains all the static assets we have inside the project e.g images, audio, documents etc)
├─── src (contains whole source code)
│ ├─── helpers (pure functions to help and serve other parts of application)
│ ├─── routes (endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests)
│ ├─── schema (data schemas to validate the data and also handle error messages)
│ ├─── services (services are independent modules that can interact with other modules and mostly used in routes directly so perform specific module related task)
│ │ └─── audio (audio module)
│ └─── utils (utilities like constant and translation etc should be placed under this folder)
└─── uploads (files that are uploaded by clients can be placed under this folder)
